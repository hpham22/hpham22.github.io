        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome! I am a recent Ph.D. graduate in Political Science from Monash
          University, Australia, where I was advised by Robert Thomson and Michael Mintrom. My research focuses on
          questions of international cooperation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly
          on how member states make collective decisions. More broadly, I am interested in comparative and
          international political economy, as well as public policy. My latest work, soon to be published in
          <em>International Relations of the
            Asia-Pacific</em>, examines the factors influencing delegation choices within ASEAN agreements, particularly
          through the lens of transaction-costs theory.
        </p>

                <div class="well well-sm abstract">According to the transaction-costs perspective on delegation,
                  decision makers grant more discretion to implementers in relation to policies that are more complex
                  and therefore require more specialist expertise to implement. Furthermore, decision makers grant
                  less
                  delegation to implementers when those implementers have divergent preferences and are therefore more
                  costly to monitor. The transaction-costs perspective has implications for the design of
                  international
                  agreements, such as those adopted by the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian
                  Nations (ASEAN). While delegation in the EU has been the subject of systematic research, delegation
                  in
                  ASEAN has not. We argue that ASEAN offers a particularly hard test of the transaction-costs
                  perspective, particularly in relation to its propositions concerning implementers’ policy
                  preferences.
                  Notwithstanding the unique characteristics of ASEAN, the evidence provides strong support for the
                  transaction-costs perspective both in terms of specialist expertise and implementers’ preferences.
                  The
                  new dataset we examine includes information on more than 8,500 major provisions within the 235 legal
                  instruments adopted by ASEAN since 1967.</div>

                    from
                    its founding in 1967 to present. Notwithstanding ASEAN’s longevity and prominence, scholars’ and
                    practitioners’ views on the of the organization vary from it being little more than a talking shop
                    to a significant force for regional integration. The present study offers evidence and analyses
                    that
                    are relevant to assessing these views. The study develops a detailed inventory of all ASEAN legal
                    instruments, including the over 200 instruments that are currently in force or have at least been
                    adopted by ASEAN. It applies an established coding framework by the Comparative Agendas Project to
                    identify the range of policy issues addressed by the organization throughout its history. The
                    paper
                    develops and tests explanations of why the scale, issue focus and content of ASEAN’s outputs have
                    varied over time. These explanations consider the impact of punctuated equilibria, whereby the
                    agenda shifts abruptly as a consequence of crises, and the effects of changes in the policy
                    preferences of ASEAN members and administrative efficiency.</div>

                    timeline for ASEAN agreements among different member states. Shifting the focus from prevalent
                    discussions on compliance mechanisms, the study delves into how ASEAN members manage their
                    regional
                    commitments, with an emphasis on administrative capacity, institutional structure, and the degree
                    of
                    agreement with the contents of the treaty. Leveraging an original ASEAN ratification dataset, the
                    study captures a comprehensive picture of intra-regional ratifications, encompassing both enforced
                    and non-enforced legal instruments across member states. The study tests derived hypotheses on a
                    set
                    of 30 instruments from 1972 to 2020, each with explicit ratification deadlines. The findings
                    indicate that more democratic ASEAN members typically delay ratification, while those with
                    efficient
                    bureaucracies expedite the process. Moreover, members expressing certain reservations about the
                    agreement to be ratified are more likely to delay ratification. These findings have important
                    implications for understanding the dynamics of ASEAN's regional integration process.
